    "TADA is one of Purdue EPICS' community based project that aims to develop, implement, and evaluate a mobile device food record (mdFR) that will translate to an accurate account of daily food and nutrient intake among adolescents and adults. Our first steps include further development of our pilot mobile computing device to include digital images, a nutrient database, and image processing for identification and quantification of food consumption. Mobile computing devices provide a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces burden on record keepers. Images of food can be marked with a variety of input methods that link the item for image processing and analysis to estimate the amount of food. Images before and after foods are eaten can estimate the amount of food consumed."
